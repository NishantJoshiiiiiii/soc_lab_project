HTTP Log Analysis using Splunk 
-->Objective

   Learn how to ingest and analyze HTTP logs in Splunk.

   Detect client errors, server errors, suspicious User-Agents, and abnormal HTTP activity.

   Identify large file transfers and suspicious URI requests.


-->Lab Tasks (SPL Queries)
   Task 1: Top 10 endpoints
      index=http_lab sourcetype="json"
      | stats count by id.orig_h
      | sort -count | head 10

   Task 2: Count server errors (5xx)
     index=http_lab sourcetype="json" status_code>=500 status_code<600
     | stats count as server_errors

   Task 3: Suspicious User-Agents
     index=http_lab sourcetype="json"
     user_agent IN ("sqlmap/1.5.1","curl/7.68.0","python-requests/2.25.1","botnet-checker/1.0")
     | stats count by user_agent

   Task 4: Large file transfers (>500 KB)
     index=http_lab sourcetype="json" resp_body_len>500000
     | table ts id.orig_h id.resp_h uri resp_body_len
     | sort -resp_body_len

  Task 5:List the most accessed suspicious uri

-->What I Observed 

   In this lab, I learned how Splunk processes HTTP logs and converts them into meaningful insights.
   By uploading the Zeek HTTP JSON logs, I understood how indexing and source types affect log parsing. 
   When running the first query, I observed which hosts generated the most web traffic, helping identify active clients. 
   The 5xx error analysis showed how often the server responded with failures, which is useful for detecting availability issues or misuse. 
   The User-Agent query revealed potential scripted tools like sqlmap, curl, and python-requests, commonly used during scanning or automated attacks. 
   Identifying large file transfers also helped detect abnormal downloads that could indicate data exfiltration attempts. Overall, this step-by-step analysis improved my SOC investigation skills by showing how HTTP logs reveal behavior, errors, and threats.
