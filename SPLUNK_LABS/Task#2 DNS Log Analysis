DNS Log Analysis Lab
-->Objective

   The objective of this lab is to help students ingest and analyze DNS logs in Splunk.
   I learned how to upload JSON-formatted Zeek DNS logs, extract useful insights such as query types, source IP activity, and domain frequency, and practice using SPL (Search Processing Language) for DNS investigations—an essential skill for SOC analysts.

-->Lab Setup

   Splunk: Installed and accessible

   Log Format: Zeek DNS logs in JSON

   File: dns.log (uploaded into Splunk)

-->Steps Performed

   In Splunk Web, navigated to Settings → Add Data → Upload.

   Selected dns.log and set Source Type: json 

   Indexed the data under dns_lab.

   Verified successful ingestion by running a basic search.

-->SPL Queries Used
   Task 1 – Most Frequently Queried Domains
   index=dns_lab sourcetype="json" | stats count by query | sort -count

   Task 2 – Most Active Source Hosts
   index=dns_lab sourcetype="json" | stats count by "id.orig_h" | sort -count

   Task 3 – DNS Query Type Breakdown
   index=dns_lab sourcetype="json" | stats count by qtype

-->What I Saw

   DNS logs successfully parsed in JSON format

   Frequent DNS queries such as A, AAAA, and CNAME lookups

   Source IPs generating high DNS traffic

   Distribution of DNS query types for traffic profiling
