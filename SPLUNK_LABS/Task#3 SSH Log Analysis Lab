SSH Log Analysis Lab
-->Objective

   The objective of this lab is to teach students how to ingest and analyze SSH authentication logs using Splunk. 
   By completing this task,I learned how to detect failed and successful SSH login attempts, identify unusual authentication patterns, and recognize potential brute-force or unauthorized access activity—critical skills for SOC analysts and incident responders.

-->Lab Setup

   Splunk: Installed and accessible

   Log Source: JSON-formatted Zeek-style SSH logs

   File Used: synthetic_zeek_ssh.json

-->Steps Performed

   Navigated to Splunk Web → Settings → Add Data → Upload.

   Uploaded synthetic_zeek_ssh.json and set Source Type: json (or custom zeek:ssh).

   Indexed the log data into ssh_lab.

   Verified successful ingestion with a test search query.

-->SPL Queries Used
  Task 1 – Top 10 Endpoints With Failed SSH Logins
    index=ssh_lab sourcetype="json" auth_success=false
    | stats count by "id.orig_h"
    | sort -count
    | head 10

  Task 2 – Total Number of SSH Connections
    index=ssh_lab sourcetype="json"
    | stats count as total_ssh_connections

  Task 3 – Count of SSH Event Types
    index=ssh_lab sourcetype="json"
    | stats count by event_type

-->What I Saw

   Parsed SSH events including successful, failed, and multi-failed authentication attempts

   Multiple source hosts attempting repeated logins (possible brute-force activity)

   Clear breakdown of event types for authentication analysis

   Total number of SSH transactions observed from the uploaded dataset
