Objective

Simulate an SSH brute-force attack and demonstrate how to detect it using Linux authentication logs. 
Learn to identify rapid failed logins, multiple usernames, and success after failure patterns that indicate brute-force activity.

Lab summary & detection

Run a controlled brute-force test from an attacker (Kali) against a target (Ubuntu) with hydra.
Monitor the target’s auth logs (/var/log/auth.log on Ubuntu.
Look for patterns: many failed attempts from a single IP, repeated targeting of sensitive accounts (root/admin), or a success immediately following many failures. 
Combine manual log inspection with automated mitigations to block repeat offenders.

Commands
# Attack (only on authorized systems you control)
hydra -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://TARGET-IP

# Ensure SSH is running on target
sudo systemctl status ssh

# Search for failed attempts
sudo grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log

# Count usernames tried
sudo grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log | awk '{print $(NF-5)}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

# Watch auth log live
sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log

Conclusion

Auth logs are essential for detecting SSH brute-force attacks. Multiple failed attempts from a single IP within a short window are strong indicators. Use log analysis plus automated blocking (fail2ban) to prevent unauthorized access and reduce risk.
