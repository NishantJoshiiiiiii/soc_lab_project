Bradesco Livelo Suspicious Email Investigation
-->Objective

   The objective of this lab is to analyze a suspicious email claiming to be from Banco do Bradesco Livelo.
   I learned to trace the origin of an email, inspect headers, validate domains and IPs, identify spoofing techniques, and extract suspicious URLs commonly used in phishing attacks.

-->Scenario

   You received an urgent email stating that your Livelo card has 92,990 points expiring today, sent from:
   banco.bradesco@atendimento.com.br

   This email encourages the user to click a link to “redeem points,” making it a strong candidate for phishing analysis.

❓ Questions to Answer

   What is the full email address of the sender?
   -- 	 BANCO DO BRADESCO LIVELO<banco.bradesco@atendimento.com.br>

   What domain is used to send this email (From / Return-Path)?
   --  atendimento.com

   What is the sender’s IP address from the header?
   -- 137.184.34.4

   Is the sender IP blacklisted? (Yes / No — based on AbuseIPDB or VirusTotal)
   --The most recent abuse report for this IP address is from 10 months ago. It is possible that this IP is no longer involved in abusive activities.(AbuseIPDB)

   What is the SPF authentication result? (Pass / Fail / Neutral)
   -- Fail

   What suspicious URL or link appears in the email body?
   -- hxxps[://]blog1seguimentmydomaine2bra[.]me/ (defang url by cyberchef)

-->What I Saw During Analysis

   The From address appeared legitimate, but the Return-Path showed a mismatched domain, indicating spoofing. The sender IP extracted from the header had a negative reputation and was blacklisted. 
   SPF validation failed, proving the sender server wasn’t authorized to send emails for that domain. The email body contained a malicious redirect URL designed to capture user credentials. 
   Urgent wording and mismatched branding further confirmed phishing intent.
