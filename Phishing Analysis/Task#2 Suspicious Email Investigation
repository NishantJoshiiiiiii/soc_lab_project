Bradesco Livelo Suspicious Email Investigation
-->Objective

   The objective of this lab is to analyze a suspicious email claiming to be from Banco do Bradesco Livelo.
   I learned to trace the origin of an email, inspect headers, validate domains and IPs, identify spoofing techniques, and extract suspicious URLs commonly used in phishing attacks.

-->Scenario

   You received an urgent email stating that your Livelo card has 92,990 points expiring today, sent from:
   banco.bradesco@atendimento.com.br

   This email encourages the user to click a link to “redeem points,” making it a strong candidate for phishing analysis.

❓ Questions to Answer

   What is the full email address of the sender?

   What domain is used to send this email (From / Return-Path)?

   What is the sender’s IP address from the header?

   Is the sender IP blacklisted? (Yes / No — based on AbuseIPDB or VirusTotal)

   What is the SPF authentication result? (Pass / Fail / Neutral)

   What suspicious URL or link appears in the email body?

-->What I Saw During Analysis

   The From address appeared legitimate, but the Return-Path showed a mismatched domain, indicating spoofing. The sender IP extracted from the header had a negative reputation and was blacklisted. 
   SPF validation failed, proving the sender server wasn’t authorized to send emails for that domain. The email body contained a malicious redirect URL designed to capture user credentials. 
   Urgent wording and mismatched branding further confirmed phishing intent.
