IOC Investigation Lab
-->Objective

   The objective of this lab is to teach SOC analysts how to extract and investigate Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) from a suspicious email. 
   I learned how to use threat intelligence platforms such as VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, URLScan, OTX, and ThreatFox to determine whether an IP, domain, or file hash is malicious. This helps analysts make faster and more accurate escalation decisions.

-->Scenario

   While triaging a phishing alert, three suspicious indicators were discovered:

   IP Address: 18.188.148.80

   Domain: aaronthompson.ug

   File Hash (SHA256): d45a079c59c2860f9cf4578a8fc9f5fe8009cff8aaa83c572474d6bfe15ba95b

   Your task is to perform threat intelligence analysis on all three IOCs using multiple free tools.

--> What I Saw During Analysis

    The IP address originated from a foreign hosting provider and displayed malicious activity records. Its country registration was identified through AbuseIPDB/VT.
    The suspicious domain showed poor reputation, recently registered infrastructure, and possible phishing intent based on URLScan.io results.
    The file hash analysis on VirusTotal revealed the file type and flagged detections by multiple engines, including associated malware names or families, confirming its malicious nature.
    These combined findings illustrate how threat intelligence helps link IOCs to phishing campaigns and hostile infrastructure.

-->Tasks
   What is the type of the malicious file?
   -- 7zip

   What country is this IP registered in?
   -- USA
   
   What malware name (if any) is associated with this file on VirusTotal?
   --trojan
