Phishing Analysis – Lookalike Domain Investigation
-->Objective

   The objective of this lab is to investigate a suspicious email and determine whether the sender domain is malicious. 
   This exercise helps understand how phishing emails use lookalike domains, deceptive content, and poor authentication settings to trick users into revealing sensitive information.

-->Scenario

   Your security team received a suspicious email claiming to be from PayPal. The sender address was:
   noreply@secure-paypai.com

   Although similar to paypal.com, the attacker registered a lookalike domain (“paypai”) to mislead users.

-->Phishing Analysis Steps

   Collect the email – Export the email as .eml or .msg.

   Analyze headers – Check Return-Path, SPF, DKIM, DMARC, and originating IP.

   Inspect the body – Look for urgency, grammar issues, unusual requests.

   Hover over links – Verify actual URLs and look for redirections.

   Check attachments – Scan files using VirusTotal or sandbox tools.

   Analyze URLs/domains – Use tools like URLScan, Whois, and VirusTotal.

   Extract IOCs – Note malicious domains, IPs, hashes, sender addresses.

   Report & respond – Block domains/IPs and warn users.

-->What I Saw

   Using VirusTotal/URLScan to check secure-paypai.com, the domain was flagged as malicious/suspicious by multiple engines. 
   It lacked authentication records and had a recently registered domain age—strong signs of phishing activity.

-->Submission

   Attach your screenshot of the domain reputation result here in the GitHub repo to complete the task.
