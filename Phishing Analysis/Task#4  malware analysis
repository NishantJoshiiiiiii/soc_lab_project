Static Analysis Lab
-->Objective

   The objective of this lab is to introduce students to the fundamentals of malware analysis using safe and publicly available tools. 
   The focus is on static analysis, where the file is examined without execution. This helps SOC analysts identify malware type, extract indicators of compromise (IOCs), and understand how threats behave before escalating incidents.

-->Scenario / Lab Overview

   In this lab, we analyze the EICAR test malware file, a harmless file used for security testing. 
   The goal is to perform basic static analysis steps such as checking hashes, reviewing metadata, inspecting strings, and scanning the file using threat intelligence platforms like VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis, and CyberChef.

-->What I Saw During Analysis

   The file hash (SHA256) was uploaded to VirusTotal, where multiple antivirus engines correctly flagged the file as “EICAR Test File,” confirming detection capability.
   Using CyberChef, the embedded base64 string decoded cleanly to reveal the EICAR signature text used for AV testing.
   Hybrid Analysis or Any.Run sandbox results showed no malicious runtime behavior (as expected), but still identified the file as a test malware sample.
   String extraction also revealed the EICAR test signature, confirming its use for detection validation rather than real malicious activity.

   These findings demonstrate how static malware analysis helps analysts extract IOCs, inspect structure, and understand file classification.
