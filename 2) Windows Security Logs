Log Analysis Basics – Windows Security Logs

Objective:
In this lab, I learned how to check and analyze Windows Security Logs to detect login attempts and other security events. 
It helped me understand how these logs play an important role in identifying unauthorized access and system changes.

Overview:
Windows Security Logs record important events such as successful and failed logins, account lockouts, and group membership changes.
Some key event IDs include 4624 for successful logins, 4625 for failed logins, 4740 for account lockouts, and 4672 for privilege escalations. 
Understanding these helps in recognizing unusual user behavior and security incidents.
Lab Task:
I created a user named IEUSER and used PowerShell to simulate a failed login with the command net use \\127.0.0.1\IPC$ /user:IEUSER WrongPassword. 
Then I opened Event Viewer → Windows Logs → Security and filtered logs by Event ID 4625. 
I could clearly see the failed login details, including the username and source network. I also checked Event ID 4624 to see what a successful login looks like.

Conclusion:
This lab taught me how to identify and interpret login-related events using Windows Security Logs.
I understood how failed login patterns and privilege changes can help detect security issues, which is a key part of a SOC Analyst’s job.
