Linux Incident Response Lab
-->Objective

   The objective of this lab is to teach students how to detect, analyze, contain, and remove malicious scripts commonly dropped inside the /tmp directory on Linux systems.
   This exercise helps SOC Analysts understand how attackers use temporary directories for staging payloads and how to respond effectively using standard Linux investigation commands.

-->Lab Overview

   In this lab, a suspicious shell script (fakebackup.sh) is detected inside /tmp, indicating potential malicious activity. 
   Students simulate a basic script execution, investigate running processes and files, terminate malicious activity, and document findings as part of the incident response process.

-->Lab Tasks
  1. Preparation
     Ensure core investigation utilities are installed: ps, lsof, curl, and grep.

  2. Detection & Analysis

     Check active processes:

     ps aux | grep fakebackup.sh


     Find suspicious scripts inside /tmp:

     find /tmp -name "*.sh"

  3. Containment & Eradication

     Kill suspicious network-related processes:

     pkill curl


     Remove the malicious payload:

     rm -f /tmp/payload.sh


     Inspect persistence using crontab.

  4. Post-Incident Activity

     Document what alerted the system, identify the executing user, and review script behavior.
     Implement recommendations such as enabling file integrity monitoring, restricting /tmp execution (noexec), and educating users on safe script practices.

-->Submission Requirements

   Submit the following screenshots:
