Suspicious Network Connection – Investigation & Response
-->Objective

   The objective of this lab is to investigate a suspicious outbound network connection on a Linux machine. 
   I learned how to detect active connections, identify the responsible process, stop malicious activity, and block further communication using firewall rules.
   This exercise simulates real SOC investigation steps for detecting beaconing or data-exfiltration behavior.

-->Scenario

   A Linux system is observed making repeated outbound connections to an unknown IP address:
   45.13.220.98:443
   This IP is not associated with any trusted service, and the pattern resembles automated beaconing. 
   To simulate this behavior, we generate a repeating network request using curl.

-->Commands Used in the Investigation
   Simulate the Suspicious Connection
   nohup bash -c 'while true; do curl http://45.13.220.98/ping >/dev/null 2>&1; sleep 30; done' &

   1. Detect Active Network Connections
   netstat -plant
   # or
   ss -plant

   2. Identify the Responsible Process
   ps aux | grep 45.13.220.98
   lsof -i :443

   3. Containment & Eradication
   kill <PID>
   pkill curl

   4. Block the Malicious IP
   ufw deny out to 45.13.220.98

-->What I Saw

  During analysis, repeated outbound traffic to the unknown IP confirmed beacon-like behavior.
  The origin was a looped curl process. After killing the process and blocking the IP with UFW, the suspicious traffic stopped completely.
