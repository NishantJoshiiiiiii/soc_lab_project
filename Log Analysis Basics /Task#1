 Introduction to Log Analysis
--> Objective

   This project introduces the fundamentals of log analysis and demonstrates how logs from Windows and Linux systems can be used for security monitoring. 
   As part of this lab, I analyzed system and PowerShell logs to understand how SOC Analysts detect, investigate, and respond to security incidents using log data.

--> Project Overview

   Logs are essential records that capture every major event occurring in a system — including user actions, system errors, or authentication attempts. 
   They contain key fields such as timestamps, event descriptions, severity levels, and source details.
   In this project, I explored how different logs are generated and where they are stored:

   Linux logs in /var/log/ (e.g., auth.log, syslog, kern.log)

   Windows logs accessible through Event Viewer, including System, Security, and Application logs.

--> Practical Task: Detecting Suspicious PowerShell Activity

   To simulate a security event, I executed the following PowerShell command:

   Get-LocalUser | Select-Object Name, Enabled

   ![PowerShell Event Log](https://github.com/NishantJoshiiiiiii/soc_lab_project/blob/c167d1ea510115fdc7b2d8acc7078c42ce0dda9c/IMG_20251109_171208843.jpg)

   This command, often used for user enumeration, was logged under Event ID 4104 in Event Viewer → Microsoft → Windows → PowerShell → Operational.
   I successfully identified and analyzed this log entry to confirm detection.

--> Learning Outcome

  Understood how logs provide visibility into system activity.

  Learned to filter and identify specific PowerShell events using Event Viewer.

  Gained practical experience in log-based threat detection, a core skill for SOC Analysts.
