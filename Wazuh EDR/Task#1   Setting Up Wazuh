Setting Up Wazuh for Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)
-->Objective

   The objective of this task is to help students set up a Wazuh Server using the Quick Start installation method and onboard an Ubuntu machine as a Wazuh agent. 
   By completing this task, learners gain practical knowledge of deploying Wazuh for security monitoring, log analysis, file integrity monitoring (FIM), and threat detection—key responsibilities of a SOC Analyst.

-->Introduction to EDR

   Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools monitor endpoint activity, detect suspicious behavior, and support incident response.
   
   SOC Analysts use EDR platforms to:

     Detect anomalies like privilege escalation, persistence, malware activity

     Correlate logs, alerts, and events

     Collect forensic artifacts (logs, memory, file changes)

     Perform threat hunting using IOCs

     Respond to compromised endpoints

   Wazuh is an open-source SIEM + EDR solution widely used for endpoint log monitoring, FIM, vulnerability detection, and threat intelligence integration.

-->Requirements

   System 1: Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 (Wazuh Server)

   System 2:kali (Wazuh Agent)

   Hardware (Server): 4 vCPU, 8GB RAM, 50GB storage

   Root/sudo access on both machines

   Both systems must communicate on the same network

-->Step 1: Install Wazuh Server
   curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.10/wazuh-install.sh && sudo bash ./wazuh-install.sh -a


  After installation, access Wazuh at:
   https://<SERVER-IP>
   Default user: admin

-->Step 2: Install & Configure Wazuh Agent
   curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.7/wazuh-agent-linux.sh && sudo bash wazuh-agent-linux.sh
   sudo nano /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf


   Set your server IP inside the <address> tag.

   Start and enable agent:

   sudo systemctl start wazuh-agent
   sudo systemctl enable wazuh-agent

-->What I Observed

   After onboarding the Ubuntu machine, the agent appeared as Active in the dashboard.
   Wazuh immediately began collecting:
 
   Authentication logs

   System activity

   File changes (FIM)

   Security events

   Command execution logs

   This shows how Wazuh provides visibility into endpoint behavior, making it useful for incident detection, monitoring, and early threat identification.

-->Submission

   Screenshot of Wazuh dashboard showing Active agent

   Screenshot from Wazuh logs confirming successful agent connection

-->Conclusion

   In this task, I successfully:

   Installed Wazuh Server using the Quick Start method

   Deployed and configured a Wazuh Agent

   Verified communication in the Wazuh Dashboard

   Observed how Wazuh supports SOC operations through continuous endpoint monitoring, log analysis, and threat detection

   This hands-on setup provides a strong foundation for understanding EDR concepts and real-world SOC workflows.
