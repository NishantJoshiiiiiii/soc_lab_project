 ICMP Protocol Analysis
-->Objective

The objective of this lab is to understand and analyze ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets using Wireshark.

-->You will learn to:

  Identify Echo Requests (Type 8) and Echo Replies (Type 0)

  Interpret ICMP packet fields such as Type, Code, Checksum, Identifier, and Sequence Number

  Apply Wireshark filters to investigate ICMP traffic

-->Files used

   Download and open the Sample PCAP file in Wireshark(online available)

-->ICMP Packet Structure and Fields
   Field Name	Description
   Type	Defines the ICMP message type
   Code	Provides further details for the message type
   Checksum	Error-checking for the ICMP header
   Identifier	Helps match requests and replies
   Sequence No.	Sequence number of the request/reply
   Data	Optional payload data

-->Common ICMP Display Filters in Wireshark
   Filter	Description
   icmp	Shows all ICMP traffic
   icmp.type == 8	Shows Echo Requests (ping)
   icmp.type == 0	Shows Echo Replies
   icmp.code == 3	Shows Destination Unreachable messages
   ip.addr == 192.168.1.10	Shows ICMP traffic from/to a specific host

-->What We Saw, During the lab:

   Echo Request (Type 8) and Echo Reply (Type 0) packets were observed.

   Each ICMP packet contained Type, Code, Identifier, and Sequence Number fields.

   By using filters such as icmp.type == 8 and icmp.type == 0, we successfully isolated ping request and reply traffic.

   The checksum verified data integrity, confirming correct packet transmission.

   This analysis helped visualize how ping works and how ICMP helps with connectivity testing and troubleshooting.

-->Conclusion

   ICMP is essential for network diagnostics and connectivity verification.

   Wireshark allows detailed inspection of ICMP traffic and helps in identifying patterns like ping sweeps or unreachable hosts.

   Understanding ICMP packet flow is valuable for SOC Analysts to detect suspicious activity or reconnaissance attempts.
