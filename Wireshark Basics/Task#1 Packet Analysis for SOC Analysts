Packet Analysis for SOC Analysts

--.Objective:
   The objective of this lab is to familiarize learners with Wireshark, one of the most widely used tools for packet analysis in a Security Operations Center (SOC) environment.
   Through this exercise, students will learn how to capture live network traffic, apply display and capture filters, and analyze packets to identify potential security incidents.
   By the end of this lab, students will understand how to differentiate between normal and suspicious communication patterns, a key skill for SOC analysts during incident detection and investigation.

-->Overview:
   Wireshark is an open-source network protocol analyzer that enables users to inspect packets traversing a network in real time or from previously captured files (PCAPs). 
   It supports hundreds of protocols and provides detailed insights into packet headers and payloads. SOC analysts rely on Wireshark for t   asks such as incident response, malware analysis, threat hunting, and network troubleshooting. 
   This lab will guide me through creating a custom profile for analysis, setting up ICMP filters, and exploring how traffic flows across the network.

-->Submission:
   submit the following screenshots as proof of completion:
