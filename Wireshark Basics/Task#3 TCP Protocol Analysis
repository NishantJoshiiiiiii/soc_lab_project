TCP Protocol Analysis

-->Objective  
   The objective of this lab is to understand and analyze **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** traffic using **Wireshark**.
   This exercise focuses on how TCP establishes and terminates connections through the **three-way handshake**, how data is reliably transmitted, and how to interpret important TCP fields and flags for network investigation.

---

-->What We Saw  
   In this lab, we examined a **sample PCAP file** in Wireshark to observe how TCP connections are initiated and terminated. 
   Using filters like `tcp.flags.syn == 1`, `tcp.flags.fin == 1`, and `tcp`, we analyzed the **connection setup (SYN)**, **data exchange (ACK/PSH)**, and **connection termination (FIN)** stages.  

-->Each TCP packet displayed key fields such as **Source Port**, **Destination Port**, **Sequence Number**, **Acknowledgment Number**, and **Flags**. We observed the **three-way handshake** process:  
   1. **SYN** – Client initiates a connection  
   2. **SYN-ACK** – Server acknowledges the request  
   3. **ACK** – Client confirms and establishes the session  

   Additionally, the **FIN** and **RST** flags were seen during connection termination and resets. 
   By applying filters like `tcp.port == 80`, we focused on HTTP-related TCP traffic, helping us understand communication between clients and servers.  

   This analysis highlighted how TCP maintains reliable communication by ensuring ordered delivery, acknowledgment of packets, and retransmission when errors occur.

-->Conclusion  
   This lab demonstrated how **TCP** guarantees reliable and ordered data delivery through its **three-way handshake** and flow control mechanisms. 
   Understanding TCP fields and flags is essential for **SOC analysts** to identify **connection states**, **troubleshoot dropped sessions**, and **detect abnormal behaviors** such as **port scans** or **RST floods** in network traffic.
