 HTTP Protocol Analysis

-->Objective  
   The objective of this lab is to understand and analyze **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** packets using **Wireshark**. 
   This exercise focuses on exploring HTTP request and response headers, understanding how client-server communication works on the web, and identifying possible indicators of HTTP-based attacks or data leaks.

-->What We Saw  
   In this lab, we opened a **sample PCAP file** in Wireshark to examine HTTP traffic between a client and a web server. 
   Using filters like `http`, `http.request.method == "GET"`, and `http.request.uri`, we viewed different types of HTTP requests and responses.  

   We observed key fields such as **Request Method (GET/POST)**, **Host**, **User-Agent**, **URI**, **Status Code**, **Content-Type**, and **Cookies**. 
   Each HTTP request from the browser contained a **method** (e.g., GET) and a **target URI**, while the server responded with a **status code** (e.g., 200 OK) and data such as web page content or files.  

   By analyzing these fields, we could see how web communication occurs at the application layer over **TCP port 80**. 
   Additionally, we noticed that sensitive data, cookies, or login details can appear in plain text, highlighting the importance of secure protocols like HTTPS. 
   The lab also demonstrated how Wireshark can reveal potential threats, such as **malware callbacks**, **data leaks**, or **unauthorized downloads**, in HTTP traffic.

-->Conclusion  
   This lab helped us understand how **HTTP** enables communication between web clients and servers. 
   Using **Wireshark**, we explored HTTP headers, request methods, and responses in detail. 
   Recognizing these patterns is crucial for **SOC analysts** to detect **data exfiltration**, **malicious payloads**, and **insecure web behavior** within network traffic.
