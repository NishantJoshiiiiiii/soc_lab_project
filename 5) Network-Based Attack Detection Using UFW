Network-Based Attack Detection Using UFW

-->Objective:
  Simulate a network-based HTTP port scan from a Kali attacker and detect it on an Ubuntu victim using UFW logs. 
  This lab demonstrates how to generate reconnaissance with nmap, capture the activity in /var/log/ufw.log, and block the offending IP with UFW rules.

-->Setup & Tools:

  Attacker: Kali Linux (nmap)

  Target: Ubuntu Linux (ufw)

  Logs: /var/log/ufw.log

  Important files: /etc/ufw/before.rules

-->Procedure (high level):

  On the attacker run a simple HTTP scan: nmap -p80 TARGET-IP.

  On the victim install and enable UFW, turn logging up to capture scan activity, and create a drop rule for the attacker IP. Monitor ufw.log to verify detection.

-->Key Commands:

  # Attack
  nmap -p80 TARGET-IP

  # On victim
  sudo apt install ufw
  sudo ufw enable
  sudo ufw logging on
  sudo ufw logging high
  sudo ufw status
  sudo ufw status numbered
  sudo ufw deny from 69.62.84.69 to any port 80 proto tcp
  sudo ufw reload
  sudo tail -f /var/log/ufw.log | grep "Attacker IP"


-->Conclusion:
   UFW logging provides clear, actionable evidence of early-stage reconnaissance. 
   Combining ufw.log analysis with targeted firewall rules lets defenders detect port scans quickly and block malicious IPs before exploitation. 
   Regularly reviewing firewall logs and proactively blocking scanners helps harden network posture.

-->Submission:
   Attach a screenshot of a syslog/ufw.log entry showing the blocked scan with source IP, targeted port (e.g., 80), and timestamp.
